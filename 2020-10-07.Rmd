## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r}
a <- 15 # 變數設定
b <- a # 呼叫a的值，用來設定變數b的值，相當於 b <- 15
y<-22
c <- y
myname <-"jordan"
```

```{r}
vNum1<-vNum2
vNum2<-c(2,vNum1)

```
```{r}
c(5,7)
c(T,F,T,F)
c("DOG","FROG")
```
NUM1 <-
```{r}
NUM1 <-5L
```
